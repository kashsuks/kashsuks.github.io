        <h2>Welcome to my site!</h2>
        <p>This is my little corner of the web where I share a bit more about myself. This site was inspired by <a href="https://dimden.dev">Dimden's</a> and several other neocities sites.</p>>
        <p>As you know, I'm a programmer, but I also do some other things (mainly STEM related).</p>>
        <p>Quick facts about me:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I've been programming since 2021</li>
            <li>I'm from India but I live in Canada!</li>
            <li>If I'm not at school, I'm either at my computer doing things or tinkering with hardware</li>
            <li>I've been a part of <a href="https://hackclub.com">Hack Club</a> for almost a year. I host, as well as attend hackathons and plan on Gap-Yearing in the future!</li>
            <li>My language of choice is Python, but I also dip into some C++ and ocassionaly Java (for robotics).</li>
            <li>I also do competitive programming! Mainly for national IO's such as the USACO and the CCC.</li>
