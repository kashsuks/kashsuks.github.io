  <p>Hey there! I'm Kashyap :p</p>
  
  <p>I began coding since I was 10 and it's best thing that has happened to me. I'm continuing what I enjoy doing @ <a href="https://hackclub.com">hack club</a></p>

  <p>I am probably:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Solving a leetcode problem</li>
    <li>Shipping some project</li>
    <li>Listening to music</li>
    <li>Doomscrolling</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Feel free to contact me: kashyap(at)hackclub(dot)help</p>

  <p>My hate for css is what caused this site</p>
